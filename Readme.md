Webapp for scheduling and arranging meetings with friends.

Uses Calendar with HebcalAPI for Jewish holidays(can be changed with the API by location holidays).
Marking dates when you're busy or available so your friends can see.

The IDEA:

Create groups with friends via Gmail\Register Account.
Calendar syncing with the group, means everyone in the group can see Events made by others in same group.
Can be used for own purpose, Presonal Calendar and Group made calendar.

Each member of the group marks dates he Available\Unavailable.
if there's a date(or more) that everyone is available you can Mark it as "Chosen Date"(sort of..).
if everyone agrees on "Chosen Date" it will create an event of a "Meeting" and sync it with google account or add to your "Events"
